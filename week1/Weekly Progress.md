	- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAvYvQr0E93OsZgyneaXGX0jaMA-zptTIxqLn83xwN0/pub?embedded=true#h.bn7syr1medcs

## New Git skills:
* Difference between git pull, rebase and merge.
* Commit's structure
* squash commits
* New Git commands:
	- git cherry-pick
	- git init
	- git reflog
	- git reset HEAD
	- git rebase -i

## IRC
* Registered on MIT IRC it turend out to be Google groups.
* Registered on JBoss Community but the channel was private:
	- Did that on FreeNode.net
	- Learned some commands from here http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/ircc-commands.html

## Side notes:
* Many organizations aren't found on OpenHub.
* Till now I can't find a varity of projects per ogranization, e.g. I only found that the MIT App Inventor works on the app inventor only.
* Bazel has no IRC channel.
* Kind of lost about browsing through the projects; shall I view the organizations' ideas list, or Dive into the organization's website.
