# GSOC-L1
Mentorship template for preparing for Google summer of Code challenge. Type = Level 1

## How to use this template?

- Mentor should fork this template.
- Mentee should join in as a contributor.

This template is designed to assist Twoleaps mentorship program. The template consists of two 
major sections: Goals and Progress tracker. Mentors and mentee should add goals prior to start of 
mentorship. Both Parties should have agreement on the goals. Progress tracker is to be updated on week
by week basis with new tasks to complete the defined goals. For each week, a folder in the repository
has to be maintained which captures the work done. It can be a small essay of things learned to code
written etc.
